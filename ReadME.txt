The assessment data files that the program accesses are located here:
Object Oriented Programming - Assessment 1\Object Oriented Programming - Assessment 1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1

I've left the actual data files in the folder 'files' so you don't have to go to that folder all the time.

Its James, just testing.
